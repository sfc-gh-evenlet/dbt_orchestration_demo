# Project Overview

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to **demonstrate various methods to orchestrate dbt (data build tool) using the Apache Airflow**. This includes showcasing:

- Integration patterns between dbt and Airflow.
- Techniques to optimize the execution of dbt jobs within Airflow DAGs.

## Why dbt with Airflow?

Leveraging the Airflow with dbt's data transformation capabilities offers:

- **Scalable**, **maintainable**, and **enhanced** data pipelines.
- Superior **monitoring**, **dependency tracking**, and **scheduling** of transformation jobs through Airflow.
- Enhanced **data quality** and **reliability** through dbt.

## What's Inside?

This repository contains:

- Sample jaffle_shop dbt model and Airflow DAGs.

## Getting Started with Orchestrating dbt using Airflow

To get started with orchestrating dbt using the Astronomer build of Airflow:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies, including the Astronomer CLI (if you want to use Astronomer Airflow for testing).

We hope this project serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to streamline their data operations with dbt and Airflow.
